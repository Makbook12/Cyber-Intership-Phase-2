# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Intern - Phase 2: Advanced Threat Simulation & Detection

## üéØ Main Objective

The goal of **Phase 2** is to simulate more advanced and realistic cyberattack scenarios and detect them using telemetry from tools like Sysmon, Winlogbeat, and SIEM platforms (Wazuh/ELK).

We will:
- Generate complex attack patterns (e.g., credential dumping, reverse shells).
- Understand advanced attacker behaviors such as beaconing, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
- Enhance detection engineering skills by analyzing logs and correlating multiple events.
- Build a threat-informed defense mindset by working through real-world use cases mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
